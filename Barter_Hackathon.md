# Barter — Voice-controlled sourcing, negotiation, and cross‑listing for resellers

**One‑liner:**  
Barter autonomously finds profitable resale opportunities, negotiates with vendors, and drafts marketplace listings — all triggered by natural voice commands.

**Who it serves:**  
Solo and small‑team resellers (watches/jewelry, sneakers/streetwear, electronics, collectibles) who win on speed, coverage, and price discovery.

## Why These Sponsors (Core, Not Checkbox)

### 1. **Amazon Bedrock** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)  
Barter’s “negotiator brain”:  
- Negotiation reasoning (offers, counteroffers, vendor-specific dialogue)  
- Listing generation (titles, specifics, price justification)  
- Structured extraction (serials, condition notes, invoice details)

### 2. **Bright Data MCP**  
Barter’s “market edge”:  
- Real-time vendor discovery and price feeds (marketplaces, niche forums)  
- Competitive pricing bands for targeted arbitrage opportunities  
- Clean vendor data feeding Bedrock reasoning and workflow triggers

### 3. **Temporal**  
Barter’s “workflow backbone”:  
- Durable source → call → negotiation → quote → draft listing workflows  
- Retries if vendors don’t answer, ensuring completion  
- Human approval checkpoints without losing state

### 4. **NLX**  
Barter’s “voice interface”:  
- NLX-powered voice widget for spoken commands and status updates  
- Conversational experience: “Find Rolex Day-Date under $12k” triggers full workflow  
- Real-time voice updates: “Negotiation complete. Draft listing ready”

## Demo Flow (3 minutes)

**0:00–0:20 — Voice Command (NLX)**  
User says: *“Find a Rolex Day‑Date 36 in NYC under $12,000, mint condition, box/papers, create draft eBay listing at 18% gross margin after fees.”*  
NLX converts this into structured intent → triggers Temporal workflow.

**0:20–0:50 — Vendor Discovery (Bright Data)**  
Live vendor table appears: name, phone, credibility, estimated price bands.

**0:50–1:50 — Negotiation & Reasoning (Bedrock)**  
Autonomous negotiation dialogue (demo voice using sandbox vendor). Bedrock calculates counteroffers and acceptable thresholds.

**1:50–2:20 — Workflow Orchestration (Temporal)**  
Workflow shows retry logic and conditional branching for negotiation outcomes.

**2:20–2:50 — Draft Listing**  
Auto-generated eBay listing: title, price, authenticity notes, shipping terms.

**2:50–3:00 — Voice Confirmation (NLX)**  
NLX voice: *“Listing ready for approval. Shall I post it?”* User says *“Yes”* → listing posted.
